  <h5>While the <code>alexandria_api.*</code> calls are ready for use, all other appbase methods are currently works in progress and may change, or be unsuitable for production use !!!</h5>

Best practice for application developers is to use one of the provided [SDK's](/sdks/) depending on what language the application is writenn in. 

If there is no such SDK, then use directly alexandria_api. In case there are some methods missing in alexandria_api, please create an issue [here](https://github.com/SophiaTX/SophiaTX/issues)
or use other API's as the last option.

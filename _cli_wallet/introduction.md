We provide a basic cli wallet for interfacing with `sophiatxd`. The wallet is self documented via command line help. The node you connect to via the cli wallet needs to be running the `account_by_key_api`, `alexnadria_api`, and needs to be configured to accept websocket connections via `webserver-ws-endpoint`.
